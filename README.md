This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple recipe project that helps you discover delightful meals using ingredients you already have in your pantry! Your Kitchen is built using the Spoonacular API, a powerful tool for accessing a vast database of recipes. Before you get started, you'll need to obtain your own Spoonacular API key.

To use the Spoonacular API for recipe retrieval, sign up on the Spoonacular website to obtain your API key. Some plans may require payment.
